# Customer Churn Prediction Project

## Overview
End-to-end machine learning project analyzing customer churn patterns and building a predictive model.

## Dataset
- **Size:** 10 customers, 7 features
- **Target:** Churn (Yes/No)
- **Source:** Synthetic telecom-style data for learning

## Project Structure
```
customer-churner/
├── data/          # Raw and cleaned datasets
├── notebooks/     # Jupyter notebooks for analysis
├── src/           # Python scripts (Week 3+)
└── README.md      # Project documentation
```

## Key Findings
1. **Contract type** is the strongest predictor (100% vs 0% churn)
2. **Price** has zero impact (correlation = 0.001)
3. **First 12 months** are critical (100% of churn happens here)

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.13
- Pandas, NumPy (data manipulation)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization)
- Scikit-learn (upcoming in Week 3)

## Progress
- ✅ Week 1: Data exploration & analysis
- ⏳ Week 2: Feature engineering
- ⏳ Week 3: Model building
- ⏳ Week 4: Evaluation & deployment
